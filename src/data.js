    a: `
      Usually, payments are processed within the hour; however, some cases
      require more attention and can take up to 24 hours to be approved. You
      will receive an email once your payment has been reviewed.

      <br/>

      If your transaction is still pending, it might be because you have yet to
      submit to a verification request. In such cases, an email is sent asking
      for proof of identity or card ownership â€“ which can land in your spam
      folder. In case of delays, please check your spam folder for a
      verification email.

      In some cases your transaction may be cancelled due to price volatility.
      All prices are locked at the time of purchase but if the price changes
      +/- 2.5% of the locked-in rate the transaction will be cancelled.
